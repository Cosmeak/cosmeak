Hi I'm Guillaume aka PereFection, web junior developper. Actually i'm learning at IIM ([Institut de l'internet et du multimédia](https://www.iim.fr/)).
If you want to learn more about me, I'm french and obviously love food 🥐, play video game a lot with my friends (*almost never alone*) 🎮 and read a lot of books (*too much books for my room*) 📚.


## How I work ?
Most of the time, I work during night because nobody can disturb me when I'm focus (*The reality is i'm too focus when I work in the evening and when I look at the time, it's already late in night or early in the morning* 😂). Otherwise I get my motivation by new project because learn for try new things is very enjoyable.
